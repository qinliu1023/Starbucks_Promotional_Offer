# Starbucks_Promotional_Offer


## Installations
1. python3: pandas, numpy


## Motivation
There are three types of offers: 
- Buy-one-get-one (BOGO): a user gets a reward equal to the threshold amount by spending a certain amount
- Discount: a user gets a reward equal to a fraction of the amount spent
- Informational: there is no reward, and neither a requisite amount that
the user needs to spend

Offers can be delivered via multiple channels. To better offer offers, we need to be clear of at least the following two things.
1. identify which groups of people are most responsive to each
type of offer
1. figure out how best to present each type of offer.
